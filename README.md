# Freeskimer

Saves and retrieves model attributes to your database with no schema. It simply serializes the object to JSON at save time and desirializes it upon retrieval.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
  gem 'freeskimer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Call `freeskim` in an ActiveRecord class and pass the name of the attribute you wish to save and the name of the column where it should be saved (has to be a string type).

```ruby
class Key < ActiveRecord::Base
  freeskim :name ,    to: :user_attributes
  freeskim :email,    to: :user_attributes
  freeskim :address,  to: :user_attributes
end
```

This will automatically save the attributes 'name' and 'email' and 'address' in json format in the 'user_attributes' column.
